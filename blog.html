    You might think food blogging is an easy, free time hobby, but creating such informative, visual treats is no easy task. In fact, it is an art (most of the time, anyway), and, as with any serious art, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication. Any cook who wants to give their recipes a twist that stands out needs not only culinary expertise but also a talent for photography (an image speaks a thousand words, remember) and the art of a wordsmith. 

    And that’s only the basics. Food blogging today takes culinary stories to a whole new level, covering much more than delectable recipes: food travel, product placement, ‘brave’ kitchen experiments, introducing new restaurants. So demanding is it that some famous food bloggers have become the new connoisseurs of the culinary world, with invites to critique some of the best and hottest places to eat around the world.
    
    From the humble platform for sharing recipes, food blogging has become highly competitive. Some bloggers have managed to build productive businesses out of their passion for food, and they come from around the world.
    
    Whether you look them up for dinner inspiration, or to indulge yourself in great-great grandma’s century old recipe, or simply to feast your eyes on the tantalizing pictures, there are myriad food blogs out there to serve your needs.
    
    Here are our best 30 food blogs of 2020. And maybe, who knows, you’ll get inspired and develop your own food blog to make this unpretentious, but nonetheless exacting, cut.

A lot of these bloggers have been there, and they enthusiastically share tips, experiments, and comparisons that will have you making top-notch craft brews in no time.

    When I first started baking cakes six years ago, I would search the internet for pictures and recipes that spoke to me. I wanted to feel inspired when I saw a cake. I wanted to find a cake that when I looked at it, I fell in love and knew I had to make that cake. I’ve pinned dozens and dozens and dozens of cake recipes from a variety of cake blogs and websites. I’ve also tried dozens and dozens of those recipes, and have come up with a list of my favorite cake blogs that have consistently provided incredible tasting cakes, helpful tutorials and tips, and inspiration for my own recipes.
    Here are my favorites:
